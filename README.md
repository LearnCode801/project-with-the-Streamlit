# Streamlit Application README

## Overview

This Streamlit application demonstrates various features and functionalities provided by Streamlit. The application allows users to interact with data and visualize it easily.

## Requirements

To run this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the directory where the `app.py` file is located and use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Basic Components

#### Text and Markdown

You can display text and markdown using `st.write()`, `st.text()`, and `st.markdown()`:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Welcome to My Streamlit App")
st.header("This is a header")
st.subheader("This is a subheader")
st.text("This is some text")
st.markdown("This is *markdown* text")
```

### 2. User Input Widgets

#### Buttons

You can create buttons that execute code when clicked:

```python
if st.button('Say Hello'):
    st.write('Hello!')
```

#### Text Input

You can accept user input with text fields:

```python
name = st.text_input("Enter your name")
st.write(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

#### Selectbox

You can use a selectbox for user choices:

```python
option = st.selectbox('Select an option', ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'])
st.write(f'You selected: {option}')
```

### 3. Data Display

#### DataFrames

You can display pandas DataFrames easily:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Column 1': [1, 2, 3], 'Column 2': [4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

st.write(df)
```

### 4. Charts and Graphs

#### Line Chart

You can create a simple line chart:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)
y = np.sin(x)

st.line_chart(y)
```

#### Bar Chart

You can create a bar chart as well:

```python
st.bar_chart(df)
```

### 5. File Uploads

You can upload files and process them:

```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", type='csv')

if uploaded_file is not None:
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.write(df)
```

### 6. Caching Data

You can use caching to improve performance:

```python
@st.cache
def load_data():
    # Load your data here
    return df

data = load_data()
```

### 7. Layouts

You can create multi-column layouts:

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.header("Column 1")
    st.write("This is column 1")

with col2:
    st.header("Column 2")
    st.write("This is column 2")
```
